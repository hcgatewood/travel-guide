### Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(package_management_software)) is a popular [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) for the Mac operating system. It makes installing things as easy as `brew install <package>`. Similarly, Homebrew Cask facilitates installing GUI applications.

### Terminal (bash)

At a high level, a [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) is an interface facilitating interaction with an operating system. The shell most developers are familiar with is the [Unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell), which provides a [command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface). Finally, [bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) is a mature, popular [shell language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_language).

[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a [distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing) [version control](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control) system. Version control allows multiple people to work on the same code base at the same time, among other benefits. Git is [wildly popular](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#work-version-control), powerful, and somewhat notorious for being [difficult to learn](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-Git-so-hard-to-learn).

### HTML/CSS

[HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets), along with JavaScript, form the cornerstone technologies of the World Wide Web. Many newer software libraries are built on top of these languages, but learning the basic building blocks is still essential.

[Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) is a [cross-platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-platform) JavaScript [run-time environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_system). In other words, while JavaScript was traditionally limited to the client-side browser, Node.js provides an environment allowing execution of JavaScript code on the [server-side](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-side). [Npm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)) is the default [package manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager) for Node.js.

### IRC

[IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) is an [application layer protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer) (same layer as the World Wide Web) facilitating text-based communication. Although it's less popular now than in the past, many open source projects communicate using the [freenode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode) IRC [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network). [Slack](https://slack.com) is a popular, easy to use, [proprietary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) alternative for team communication.

### Blockchain

A [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) is a continuously growing list of [timestamped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timestamp) "blocks." Each block functions as a [record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science)), allowing a blockchain to function as a [distributed database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database). The idea of a blockchain is relatively new, first described in 2008 by an unknown person using the assumed pseudonym [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto). [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin), on the other hand, is the [original](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) in a long line of [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) utilizing blockchain technology.
