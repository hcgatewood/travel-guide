# The New Programmer's Travel Guide

A curated guide to relevant resources for the new computer science student‚Äîit's everything else you'll need to know.

Learning to program is hard. Finding your way to first-rate resources, however, just got a whole lot easier. See the [usage notes](#using-this-guide) for an intro. This guide assumes you're on a Mac, but is valuable on any machine.

The `mongod` daemon starts and manages the database, the `mongo` command starts a shell-like connection to the database, and specific languages interact with the database through drivers (_i.e._ [bindings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_binding)).

### Regex

A [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression) is a string defining a search pattern. A regex functions as a declarative way to perform _find_ or _find and replace_ string operations. There are multiple flavors with often incompatible syntaxes. It's [pronounced like FedEx, with the "g" from "regular."](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/94371/what-is-the-correct-pronunciation-of-regex)

### Serialization

[Serialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization) is the process of converting an in-memory structure to a format that can be readily stored and/or transmitted. Often this takes the form of translating a language-specific object to a language-agnostic string or [bytestream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitstream).

[C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) is a general-purpose programming language with [static typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_type_checking). It was developed in the early 1970s and is historically [one of the most popular languages of all time](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index//). It's a [medium-level language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-level_programming_language) that maps efficiently to [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code). C is considered more [difficult to learn](https://www.quora.com/How-easy-is-it-to-learn-C) than higher-level languages like Python and JavaScript, but [learning C is worth it](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/14744/i-dont-know-c-and-why-should-i-learn-it).

### LaTeX

[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) is a document preparation system. It's especially popular in academia, and is used in many STEM-related fields. It allows users to focus on a document's contents and let LaTeX focus on the document's preparation and formatting.

### IRC

[IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) is an [application layer protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer) (same layer as the World Wide Web) facilitating text-based communication. Although it's less popular now than in the past, many open source projects communicate using the [freenode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode) IRC [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network). [Slack](https://slack.com) is a popular, easy to use, [proprietary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software) alternative for team communication.

### Blockchain

A [blockchain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) is a continuously growing list of [timestamped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timestamp) "blocks." Each block functions as a [record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_(computer_science)), allowing a blockchain to function as a [distributed database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_database). The idea of a blockchain is relatively new, first described in 2008 by an unknown person using the assumed pseudonym [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto). [Bitcoin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin), on the other hand, is the [original](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) in a long line of [cryptocurrencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency) utilizing blockchain technology.

### Why a travel guide

Learning to build software is hard. And not knowing what to learn, when, and from where makes it harder. Google searches return 1000's of results, but knowing which links to trust is unlear. That's where the travel guide comes in: a listing of what to learn, in an ordering that makes sense, paired with specific, curated resources. This isn't a resource dump‚Äîit's a travel guide.
